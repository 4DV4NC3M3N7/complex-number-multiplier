# complex-number-multiplier
i built a 16bits signed complex number multiplier, the multiplier comprise of 32 adders 32bits signed that are use for multiplication and two adder for extending the sign of the multiplicant and multiplier.
  The general function of the multiplication between two complex numbers is : ( a + bi ) x ( c + di ) = ( ac - bd ) + ( ad + bc )i
Below is the Multiplier top-design RTL view of the design
